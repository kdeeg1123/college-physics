## Concepts of Motion and Mathematical Background
* Motion: the change of an object's position or orientation with respect to time
* Trajectory: The path along which an object moves (may be a straight or curved line)
* Motion Diagram: diagram of an object's position at several equally spaced intervals
* Position: the location of an object 
* Displacement ($\Delta$): the change in position
* Velocity: indicates an object's speed **and** direction
  * $v = \frac{displacement}{time interval} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
* Scalar: a single number with a unit (Ex. $30\degree C$)
* Vector: a quantity with both a size (*how far/fast?*) and direction (*which way?*)
  * Magnitude: the length of the vector (positive or zero but **never** negative)


## Motion in One Dimension
* Uniform Motion: an object with constant velocity (velocity graph is a horizontal line while the position graph is linear). Special case of constant-acceleration models in which $a_x = 0$
  * $x_f = x_i + v_x \Delta t$
* Kinematics: mathematical description of motion without regard to the causes
* Instantaneous Velocity: an object's velocity - *speed **and** direction* - at a specific instant of time $t$
* Acceleration: the rate of change of velocity
  * $a_x = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t}$
  * Constant Acceleration Equations:
    | Equation | Description |
    |:--------:|:-----------:|
    | $(v_x)_f = (v_x)_i + a_x\Delta t$ | Describing an object's velocity |
    | $x_f = x_i + (v_x)_i\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a_x(\Delta t)^2$ | Describing an object's position |
    | $(v_x)_f^2 = (v_x)_i^2 + 2a_x\Delta x$ | Relating velocity and displacement |
* Visual Overview: representing a problem into a graphical/visual representation
  * Motion Diagram
  * Pictorial Representation: sketching a problem indicating the object at the beginning **and** end of motion and defining all necessary symbols/variables
  * Graphical Representation: particularly for motion problems, graphing position and/or velocity can be useful
  * List of values: thought of as a table of data points
* Free Fall ($g$): the motion of an object moving under the influence of gravity only and no other forces (free fall occurs only in a vacuum - neglect air resistance)
  * $\overrightarrow{a}_{freefall} = 9.80 \frac{m}{s^2}$ vertically down
*
